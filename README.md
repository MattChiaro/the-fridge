## Description

The Fridge - Social Media, centralized. A Social platform that is centered around small groups, The Fridge is the place to post important updates, notices, and achievements. 

Much like your refrigerator in your home, plastered with notes, pictures, and reminders, The Fridge is the meeting place for your household or small group. Got a new job? Post it on The Fridge. Need to remind your roommates to take out the trash? Post it on The Fridge. Want to share a funny meme? Post it on The Fridge.
